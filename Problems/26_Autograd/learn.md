# Understanding Mathematical Concepts in Autograd Operations

**First, watch the video in the Solution section.**

This task focuses on implementing basic automatic differentiation mechanisms for neural networks. The operations of addition, multiplication, and ReLU are fundamental to neural network computations and their training through backpropagation.

### Mathematical Foundations

**Addition (`__add__`):**
- **Forward Pass:** For two scalar values \( a \) and \( b \), their sum \( s \) is:
  \[
  s = a + b
  \]
- **Backward Pass:** The derivative of \( s \) with respect to both \( a \) and \( b \) is 1. During backpropagation, the gradient of the output is passed directly to both inputs.

**Multiplication (`__mul__`):**
- **Forward Pass:** For two scalar values \( a \) and \( b \), their product \( p \) is:
  \[
  p = a \times b
  \]
- **Backward Pass:** The gradient of \( p \) with respect to \( a \) is \( b \), and with respect to \( b \) is \( a \). During backpropagation, each input's gradient is the product of the other input and the output's gradient.

**ReLU Activation (`relu`):**
- **Forward Pass:** The ReLU function is defined as:
  \[
  R(x) = \max(0, x)
  \]
  This function outputs \( x \) if \( x \) is positive, and 0 otherwise.
- **Backward Pass:** The derivative of the ReLU function is 1 for \( x > 0 \) and 0 for \( x \leq 0 \). The gradient is propagated through the function only if the input is positive; otherwise, it stops.

### Conceptual Application in Neural Networks
- **Addition and Multiplication:** These operations are ubiquitous in neural networks, forming the basis for computing weighted sums of inputs in the neurons.
- **ReLU Activation:** Commonly used as an activation function in neural networks due to its simplicity and effectiveness in introducing non-linearity, making learning complex patterns possible.

Understanding these operations and their implications on gradient flow is crucial for designing and training effective neural network models. By implementing these from scratch, you gain deeper insights into the workings of more sophisticated deep learning libraries.
